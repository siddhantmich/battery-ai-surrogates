            Rapid assessment and accurate forecasting of the battery state-
of-health are essential for Lithium-ion battery usage and lifespan
optimization. However, physics-based solvers are computationally
intensive, and traditional surrogate models fail to handle time-series
data and dynamically changing conditions. In this paper, the authors
investigate a traditional deep learning model, LSTM, for its utility as
a good surrogate model for the computationally expensive physics
solvers, as well as the neural operators DeepONet and a state-space
model modification called Mamba-DeepONet, for surrogate mod-
eling of Single Particle Model simulations. Our results show that
while DeepONet is not very good at capturing the battery dynamics,
both LSTM and Mamba-DeepONet can function as effective sur-
rogate models for batteries. We then conduct parameter inference
using Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm and find
that both LSTM and Mamba-DeepONet models show similar perfor-
mance for parameter inference. Owing to the high parallelizability
and the potential to train on much longer time-series sequences in
the future, we make a case for why Mamba-DeepONet should be
used for surrogate battery models in the future.
